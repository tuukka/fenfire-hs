===================
Fenfire version 0.2

http://fenfire.org/

Introduction
============

Fenfire is a graph-based notetaking system built on Semantic Web technologies 
and including features for Linked Data browsing. (We're planning to add a
kitchen sink soon.) It is developed on the channel #fenfire on the
Freenode IRC network.


The source code is available using Darcs.

Compiling and running
=====================

Fenfire-hs is packaged using the Haskell Cabal, which means you can use the 
following commands to configure, build, and install it to your home directory:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user --prefix ~
runhaskell Setup.hs build
runhaskell Setup.hs install

After this, you can start the application like this:

~/bin/fenfire


Editing
=======

You will see the application launch with a new graph where you can
start adding your notes using the Edit menu and the included key bindings.

* The current node is highlighted in color.

* To write into the current node, move to the text box at the bottom
  of the window using Tab or the mouse. After you've finished typing,
  use Tab or the mouse to get back to the graph box.

* Use the Edit menu or the keybindings indicated in the Edit menu to
  - create new nodes
  - mark the current node, or connect the current node to the
    previously marked node(s)
  - break connections between nodes

* Use the arrow keys to move between nodes:
  - Left and Right move to the node directly left or directly right
    from the current node.
  - Up and Down scroll through the nodes connected to the current node.
  - Instead of Left/Right/Up/Down, you can also use j/l/i/comma.

* To use a node as a connection between others, you can add it as a property
  and choose it for use for new connections.

You cannot currently use the mouse to move around the structure.


Node URIs
=========

Following the Semantic Web and RDF, each node and connection has a URI (more
accurately an IRI as international characters are supported). Normally, 
Fenfire generates random-looking URIs of the URN-5 type, and hides them
by displaying the node label instead.

* You can reveal the underlying URI by applying the menu item 
  "Edit -> Remove literal text".

* You can change the underlying URI with "Edit -> Change node's IRI".

  - Full URIs are written in angle brackets: <http://fenfire.org/>

  - URIs under namespaces such as rdfs can be shortened: rdfs:seeAlso

We don't currently provide means to declaring namespaces in addition to those
that are in a document when it's opened.


Linked Data browsing
====================

* Start by choosing the menu item "File -> Go to IRI" and enter in angle 
  brackets a http URI of a resource available in RDF.

* Use "File -> Load node's IRI" to follow links between documents, that is,
  load more data from the URI of the current node.

Data loaded from other documents is not saved.
