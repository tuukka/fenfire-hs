===================
Fenfire version 0.1
===================


Introduction
============

Fenfire is a graph-based notetaking system. (We're planning to add a
kitchen sink soon.) It is developed on the channel #fenfire on the
Freenode IRC network.


The source code is available using Darcs.

Compiling and running
=====================

Fenfire-hs is packaged using the Haskell Cabal, which means you can use the 
following commands to configure, build, and install it to your home directory:

runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user --prefix ~
runhaskell Setup.hs build
runhaskell Setup.hs install

After this, you can start the application like this:

~/bin/fenfire

You will see the application launch with a new graph where you can
start adding your notes using the Edit menu and the included key bindings.

* The current node is highlighted in blue.

* To write into the current node, move to the text box at the bottom
  of the window using Tab or the mouse. After you've finished typing,
  use Tab or the mouse to get back to the graph box.

* Use the Edit menu or the keybindings indicated in the Edit menu to
  - create new nodes
  - mark the current node, or connect the current node to the
    previously marked node(s)
  - break connections between nodes

* Use the arrow keys to move between nodes:
  - Left and Right move to the node directly left or directly right
    from the current node.
  - Up and Down scroll through the nodes connected to the current node.
  - Instead of Left/Right/Up/Down, you can also use j/l/i/comma.

You cannot currently use the mouse to move around the structure.
